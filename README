"Default Optimized" is a modification of the "Default" xfwm4 theme
meant to save more screen space while maximizing clickable pixels.

• The title bar is 4 pixels shorter.
• The buttons are nearly twice as wide.
• There is no unclickable 2-pixel gap between buttons.
• The buttons are set inward 3 pixels for easier corner resizing
  while still being clickable against the edge of the screen maximized.
• The top border clickable region for resizing is 1 pixel thicker.

SVG based theme for xfwm4.
